# Problem Statement : Mentor Portal 
## A Portal specifically designed for mentoring students within IIT Madras BS Degree.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Students of the IITM Online BSc degree program are diverse, in terms of age, background and
experience. Due to the online nature of the program, there arenâ€™t many opportunities to meet
and learn from seniors compared to traditional college experiences, where a lot of learning and
mentoring happens through interactions with seniors and alumni.
Your goal is to create an online student mentoring platform for the IITM BSc degree program
students. The platform should allow users to enroll as mentors. A mentor can be anyone
currently in the program (the system should admit alumni as well in the near future!) who would
like to provide mentorship to students. The platform should also allow other students to join, and
provide provisions for users to search and connect with mentors (through chat, audio/video call
etc.) based on their preference and expertise.
